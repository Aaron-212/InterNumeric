## OpenType Features

- Slashed Zero
- Case-sensitive Form

## Roadmap

- Alternate form for 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9
- Tabular Forms
- Include some capital letter so that we can use A.M. and P.M.? Maybe?

## Issues

Inter Numeric is still in early stage of development. Start an issue if you find any problems.

## Sidenotes

Inter Numeric is actually inspired by iOS/iPadOS/macOS/watchOS lockscreen digital clock's font, SF Soft Numeric.
The original font file is located at `/System/Library/Fonts/ADTNumeric.ttc`.
But it is a hidden font, so most Mac apps cannot use it.
